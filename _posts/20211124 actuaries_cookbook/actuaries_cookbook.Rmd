I am grateful to the Actuaries Institute of Australia for supporting the launch of an Actuaries Institute Analytical Cookbook. The result of significant collaboration, the cookbook is way more comprehensive than I could have imagined. It covers topics from setting up in R and Python to pricing and experience investigation techniques, (un)supervised learning, natural language processing and more.
