# Overview {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
## Background 
This document sets out a few practical recipes for modelling with (life) insurance data. Insurance events are typically of low probability - these recipes consider some of the limitations of "small data" model fitting (where the observations of interest are sparse) and other topics for insurance like comparisons to standard tables. Themes

* Common data transforms, summary stats, and simple visualisations
* Regression 
  + Grouped vs ungrouped data
  + Choice of: response distribution, link (and offsets), explanatory variables 
  + Modelling variance to industry/ reference (A/E or A - E)
  + Model selection: stepwise regression, likelihood tests, model evaluation
  + Predictions, confidence intervals and visualisations
* Bayesian regression and other classification models - to follow.
